# Whitelines paper makes your notes stand out.

The basic idea is to let the app and the paper actually see each other and the rest will happen automatically. Make sure the four corner markers are visible in the display – hold still for a moment – let the app capture your note – and save or share your note in a way you like.

## About Whitelines white lines

Whitelines is the new generation of writing paper. The concept is patented and yet very simple: Since markings from pens are dark they interfere with the traditional dark lines of ordinary paper. On Whitelines there is no visual interference between the lines and the pen color. Whitelines makes your writing and drawings stand out.
